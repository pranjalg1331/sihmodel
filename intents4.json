                "In Delhi, there are several modes of transportation available for people of all ages. Depending on your holiday style and budget, you can choose from the following 3 options:\nBy Metro: Take a direct metro from the Indira Gandhi International Airport to Rajiv Chowk and then another metro from Rajiv Chowk to Pragati Maidan. After reaching there, you can enjoy a short stroll as it is only 1.2 km away.\nBy Bus: Another convenient way is via a local bus. Catch a state-owned bus outside the airport to reach your desired destination at pocket-friendly prices. For your ease, many private buses are also available at the airport for tourists to roam around and explore the popular sightseeing places in Delhi.\nBy Cab: Lastly, if you're looking for extra comfort, choose to hire a rental taxi from Ola/Uber or simply go ahead with a private cab from the list of top car rental companies in Delhi. The National Science Centre is approximately 15 km away from the airport and it will take nearly 25 to 30 minutes to cover the required distance by cab."
