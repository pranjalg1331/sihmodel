After reaching there, you can enjoy a short stroll as it is only 1.2 km away.\nBy Bus: Another convenient way is via a local bus. Catch a state-owned bus outside the airport to reach your desired destination at pocket-friendly prices. For your ease, many private buses are also available at the airport for tourists to roam around and explore the popular sightseeing places in Delhi.\nBy Cab: Lastly, if you're looking for extra comfort, choose to hire a rental taxi from Ola/Uber or simply go ahead with a private cab from the list of top car rental companies in Delhi. The National Science Centre is approximately 15 km away from the airport and it will take nearly 25 to 30 minutes to cover the required distance by cab."

                    "Delhi mein har umr ke logon ke liye kai tareeke ke transportation available hain. Apne holiday style aur budget ke hisaab se, aap inme se 3 options chun sakte hain:\nBy Metro: Indira Gandhi International Airport se Rajiv Chowk ke liye direct metro lein aur phir Rajiv Chowk se Pragati Maidan ke liye doosri metro lein. Wahan pahunchne ke baad, aap thoda walk kar sakte hain kyunki yeh sirf 1.2 km doori par hai.\nBy Bus: Ek aur convenient tareeka local bus ke zariye hai. Airport ke bahar se ek state-owned bus pakdiye apne desired destination par pocket-friendly prices mein pahunchne ke liye. Aapki suvidha ke liye, kai private buses bhi airport par available hain jo tourists ke liye dilli ke popular sightseeing places explore karne mein madad karti hain.\nBy Cab: Lastly, agar aap extra comfort chahte hain, toh Ola/Uber se ek rental taxi hire karein ya simply Delhi ke top car rental companies ke list se ek private cab chun lein. National Science Centre approximately airport se 15 km doori par hai aur yeh lagbhag 25 se 30 minutes lagenge yeh distance cab se cover karne mein."
